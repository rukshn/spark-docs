# Introduction

Clinical Quality Language (CQL) is a domain-specific language designed for representing clinical knowledge and quality measures in healthcare. Developed as a replacement for earlier languages, CQL provides a human-readable, computable format that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and technical implementation.
