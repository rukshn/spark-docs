## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why use CQL Editor?

- CQL Editor will provide an organization to maintain a central CQL library and most importantly documentation that is easy to maintain and collaborate with different CQL authors within the organization.
- Allow users / clinicians / guideline authors to easily write CQL with a friendly user interface and parsing of CQL in a human readable format.
- The CQL editor will highlight syntax and keywords and provides an overall nice user experience in writing and managing CQL
- Export the CQL in a FHIR friendly format through an API that can be used by other applications and CDSS
