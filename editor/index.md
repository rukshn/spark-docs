# Introduction to the Editor

The editor is the place where you write your CQL and the most special part of the The Spark Editor.

It suggests keywords to autocomplete your CQL, does syntax highlighting to read your CQL more easily, as well as checks your CQL for accuracy, and shows any errors and where it's happening.

The editor is also the place where you can parse your CQL and make it more human-readable.

CQL documentation is also built-in to the editor, making it easier to write CQL and even understand CQL without referring the documentation.
