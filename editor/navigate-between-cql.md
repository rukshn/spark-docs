# Navigating Between Different CQL

One of the features in CQL is to include different CQL from multiple files, allowing reusability of CQL code and reducing the need to re-write the same CQL again in different files.

You include one CQL in another by using the `include` keyword. Here when you are coding CQL in the CQL Editor, you can easily navigate and peek inside the included CQL, without having to leave the CQL you are currently editing.

You can do that by simply hovering over the CQL next to the `include` keyword, press `Ctrl` and click over the included CQL.

This will open a small editor on the side and you can easily view the included CQL. You can even navigate to the CQL by clicking the name of the CQL at the top of the preview editor, and a new tab would open for you with the included CQL.
