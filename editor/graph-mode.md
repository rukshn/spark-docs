# Graph Mode

You can now visualize CQL logic as an interactive graph using the graph mode in the Spark Editor.

This allows anyone to easily understand and review coded clinical logic by visualizing it as a graph and making changes within the editor.

:::tip
The graph mode currently does not support the full CQL specification and is limited to selected logical elements, but more features will be added to cover more of the specification.
