# Writing CQL in the Editor

You can start using the editor straight away, even without uploading a CodeSystem. However, you won't get the auto-complete. But you can still use the built-in documentation to understand the meaning of different keywords.

You can even start writing CQL if you are not in an active project. But you will need to be in an active project to save the CQL.

## How to check the meaning of a keyword?

If you would like to check the meaning of a keyword according to the CQL documentation, you can simply hover over that keyword and the editor will show the definition of that keyword for you according to the CQL documentation.
