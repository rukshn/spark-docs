# Data Dictionary

In a Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK), one of the most important components is the data dictionary.

The data dictionary can include:

- Clinical terminologies and diagnosis (Measles),
- Questions (Recent travel to a high Malaria risk area),
- Metadata (Malaria risk in a given area),

These concepts are given uniquely identifiable codes by the DAK publisher. For example, the Clinical Care in Crisis DAK defines measles as `CHE.B23.DE32`. This avoids ambiguity in the data being exchanged and coded.

The data dictionary may also include mappings to other terminologies such as ICD-10 or ICD-11.

Currently, WHO publishes the data dictionary as a large Excel file when releasing a DAK.
